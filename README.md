# The Schedule for KMUTT's Computer Engineering (Inter) Year 2 semester 1.
I made... er, I mean I used AI to create this, because the schedule that KMUTT provides wasn't visually pleasing... <br>
It works on both PC and mobile, with PC having the horitozal view and the mobile version having the vertical view.

# Things to maybe do when I feel like it:
- [ ] Highlight ongoing classes
- [ ] Add custom colors
- [ ] Function to add and remove courses
- [ ] Actually learn how to use HTML, CSS, and Javascript so that you won't have to castigate AI to do it.
